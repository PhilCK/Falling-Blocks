# Falling Blocks
This was a little game I wrote ages ago when I was getting into game programming.


## Controls
- Menu: `up` and `down` to navigate. `enter` to start a mode.
- In-game: `left` and `right` to move. `space bar` to drop. `up` to rotate.
- Game-Over: `enter` to continue.
- Quit: `escape` at any point to close the application.


## Platform
I would expect anything that runs Gosu/Ruby should run this, but only tested on OSX.


## Requirements
- Ruby 1.8+ (Tested on 2.1.5)
- Gosu 0.8+ ([https://github.com/jlnr/gosu](https://github.com/jlnr/gosu))
